# Monopoly Classic edition

Monopoly is a game in which each player has a piece that moves around a game board, with the piece's change in location determined by rolling a pair of dice. The game board consists of a set of properties(initially owned by a bank) that may be purchased by the players.

When a piece lands on a property that is not owned, the player may use money to buy the property from the bank for that property's price. If a player lands on a property she already owns, she may build houses and hotels on the property. each house and hotel costs some price specific for the property. When a player's piece lands on a property owned by another player, the owner collects money(rent) from the player whose piece landed on the property.

The game is played until only one remaining player has money and property, with all other players being bankrupt.
